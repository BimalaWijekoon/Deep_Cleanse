AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
---------------------
1. The model performs worst on gaussian_high noise.
   Consider fine-tuning specifically for this noise type.

2. Common characteristics in worst-performing images:
   - Consider fine-tuning on images with high-frequency details or textures
   - Test more augmentation techniques during training
   - Consider adaptive noise level estimation to handle varying noise levels

RECOMMENDATIONS:
---------------
1. Fine-tune the model with mixed noise types for better generalization
2. Consider increasing the depth or capacity of the model
3. Experiment with attention mechanisms to better handle complex textures
4. Implement a noise level estimation module for adaptive denoising
